# iReARM - iPod ARM motherboard
A plug-in replacement iPod Video/Classic motherboard with modern ARM processor. 

This project's goal is to create from scratch a plug-in replacement motherboard for Apple's iPod Video & Classic (5th, 5.5th, 6th, 6.5th and 7th generation), which will reuse iPod's original: 
* LCD;
* Click Wheel:
* Lock Switch & AUX assembly.

# Features
The new motherboard will have dimensions exactly the same as the original iPod's board and will be based on ARM CPU.
It will include the next set of features:
* Runs Linux;
* iPod-like UI;
* Wi-Fi & Bluetooth;
* Apple's 30 pin connector for charging, syncing and USB OTG (USB Type-C variant will also be available);
* Micro SD card slot, accessible from the inside of device (no hot swap);
* Future support of higher definition LCD panels (different board variant).

# Ideas & discussion

Here I will write my and others ideas regarding this project.
For now, I'm currently thinking about what CPU to choose. Variant for now are:
* Amlogic S905Y2 (the smallest one, that will easily fit on the iPod mobo and won't interfere with metal inner cage);
* Rockchip RK3328;
* Rockchip RK3566;

Please note that I'm new to embedded ARM Linux computers & PCB development, so I'm looking for well documented CPU, those 3 that I've listed are used in RADXA SBC, and they kindly provide all schematics for their SBC's.

# DISCLAIMER
I'm a daytime student in Lodz University of Technologies, Poland and this project is my side thing, for self development.
So for all of You who are looking forward to buying or source this project, please be patient and give me my time;)
Definitely I will give this project a priority because of all the interest around it, so I hope that Your interest will stay like that or be even higher, and I promise to all of You interested in this project to finish it as soon as possible!
